# Flutter UI Implementation

## Overview
In this homework, we are tasked with making a UI for a profile page that implments a stepper widget, and a TabBar.

## ProfilePage

### Personal Info
In this tab of the profile screen, the user is able to view the worker's personal info, which could help the employer instantly communicate with them.
